# Final-Project-7770
The 4 NetLogo code files are stored in 
  Reynolds Notch-Delta.nlogo (the original model that all the work in this project is based on)
  Static Differentiation Cascade.nlogo (the simulation of the Morsut et al. 3 layer cascade)
  Static Differentiation Pulse.nlogo (the simulation of the new pulse circuit structure)
  Simple Cadherin.nlogo (the implementation of the random walking Cadherin cells which self assemble into a ball)
  
The 3 movie files are stored in
  MorsutStaticDifferentiationCascade.mp4 (shows a single green cell causing a 3 layer system to form)
  Static Differentiation Pulse.nlogo (shows a single green cell propagating a 3 layer pulse until it hits the wall)
  SimpleCadherin.mp4 (shows a random spread of cadherin expressing cells self assembling into set of nuclei in a sea on nonexpressing cells)
  
One note about running NetLogo code:
  Many user-set variables in netlogo are derived directly from the GUI. This makes it difficult to 
  run a new model from the txt code in the code tab alone. All the models given here have GUI variables
  so they must be run directly from the NetLogo files given.
  
  To run any of these NetLogo models, simply start by clicking the setup button on the left. Then click on and of the go buttons.
  Go-x runs the model for x ticks. Go with the spiral arrows runs the code until clicked again.
